# Breakout-Game

This is a game that i coded in 10th grade. It is breakout, but it's coded entirely in java, using only java libraries. It was part of the stanford
intro to java course. Some of the code may be using certain imports that were used in that class. 

I copy pasted the code in, but I also included the file, so feel free to take a look
